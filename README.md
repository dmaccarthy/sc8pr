# sc8pr

An educational programming package for [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org). Inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Processing](https://www.processing.org), **sc8pr**’s aim is to make it easy for new and experienced Python programmers to create animations, games, and other graphics-based programs.

# Try It First

**sc8pr** is pure Python 3 code, so you can try it without running the setup. Just unzip the **sc8pr** package into your PYTHONPATH. You will still need **pygame 1.9** or **2.0** installed for current **sc8pr** versions and **pygame 1.9** for older versions.
