# sc8pr

An educational programming package for [Python 3](https://www.python.org). Inspired by [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Processing](https://www.processing.org), **sc8pr**’s aim is to make it easy for new and experienced Python programmers to create animations, games, and other graphics-based programs.
